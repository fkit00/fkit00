# Hi there, i'm Fiona, 

In 2022, i started coding after getting onto a full stack bootcamp run by the fabulous folks at the School of Code. 

Before the start of the course i had just finished my masters in Violence, Terrorism and Security, with a focus on gender and radicalization within the far-right on social media (and am always up for a chat about it!). 

I'm really interested in Back-end development, Testing and Accessibility and right now am working on getting my brain around Python and TypeScript as well as expanding my knowledge of cyber security!

You can find me at TryHackMe under the username boobear - I'm currently working through the web hacking path and the advent of cyber!

What i've been using!
